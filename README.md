# Name-Searcher
This program written in C++ uses a binary search tree in order a name that the user asks from a database containing the 1,000 most popular names for boys and girls in the United States. If the name is not found, the program will tell the user that the name was not found and ask for another name to search. If the name is found, then it will return the name, a percentage of popularity, and the rank of the name.
